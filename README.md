# `cfg`

> macOS only

### Installation

```shell
git clone git@github.com:spejamchr/cfg.git ~/cfg
```

### Usage

```shell
~/cfg/install.sh
```

If you'd prefer existing dotfiles get overwritten:

```shell
OVERWRITE=true ~/cfg/install.sh
```

This script will:

1. Ensure several directories exist
2. Install a bunch of stuff (see below for the list)
3. Backup existing dotfiles (Unless you specify `OVERWRITE=true`)
4. Symlink the dotfiles stored in this repo into place

### Prerequisites

1. macOS
2. `ruby` and `git` (installed by default on macOS)

You shouldn't have to install anything to run the install script.

### Debugging

The script will output information to `STDOUT` and store a logfile in the repo at `.install.log`.

### Organization

The `install.sh` script and the logfile, `.install.log`, are both at the root of the repo (though
the logfile is not tracked by git). The `home/` directory holds all the dotfiles. It is organized
such that a file `home/something` will be symlinked to `~/.something`, and `home/dir/descendant`
will be symlinked to `~/.dir/descendant`.
