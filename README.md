# `cfg`

> macOS only

### Install/Usage

```shell
curl -Lks https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spejamchr/cfg/master/install.sh | /bin/bash
```

If you'd prefer existing dotfiles get overwritten:

```shell
OVERWRITE=true curl -Lks https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spejamchr/cfg/master/install.sh | /bin/bash
```

This script will:

1. Clone this repo to `$HOME/.dotfiles`
2. Ensure several directories exist
3. Install a bunch of stuff (see below for the list)
4. Backup existing dotfiles (Unless you specify `OVERWRITE=true`)
5. Symlink the dotfiles stored in this repo into place
6. Install `zsh` plugins

### Prerequisites

1. macOS
2. `ruby`, `git`, and `zsh` (installed by default on macOS)

You shouldn't have to install anything to run the install script.

### Debugging

The script will output information to `STDOUT`, and if the script successfully
clones this repo it will store a logfile in the repo at `.install.log`.

### Organization

The `install.sh` script and the logfile, `.install.log` are both at the root of
the repo (though the logfile is not tracked by git). The `home/` directory holds
all the dotfiles. It is organized such that a file `home/something` will be
symlinked to `~/.something`, and `home/dir/descendant` will be symlinked to
`~/.dir/descendant`.
